libfep -- a library to implement FEP (front end processor) on ANSI terminals

WIP.

Features:

* Render text at the bottom of the terminal.
* Render text at the cursor position.
* Send text to the child process.
* Monitor key strokes typed on the terminal.

Test:

$ echo $SHLVL
1
$ fep -e /bin/sh
$ echo $SHLVL
2
$ ./tests/fepcli -s "foo" # show text at the bottom
$ { sleep 1; ./tests/fepcli -c "foo"; } & # show text at the cursor
$ { sleep 1; ./tests/fepcli -f "bar"; } & # send text to the child process
$ ./tests/fepcli -l # wait for a key event
# type any key
keyval = XX, modifiers = XX
$
